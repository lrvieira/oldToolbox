A few of the codes I used during my mechanical engineering program. Please notice there might be some errors as I was new to programming back then and I didn't bother to correct them. It's intented for personal reference, but might be useful for someone...

barkhausen/: When I worked as a researcher assistant on the use of Barkhause Noise to characterize steels. The codes format a raw text file with the data from barkhausen test to be used by a two C programs, namely to evaluate their mean and to process their RMS value.

GranTurismo/: An assignment I had. I quite like racing simulators, so I recorded and exported data from Gran Turismo 6 to evaluate some physical quantites the game considered (friction coefficient, forces, etc.). Professor was happy so I got an A+.
